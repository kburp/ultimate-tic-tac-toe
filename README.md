# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe

#### Want to try a new game? Tired of boring Tic Tac Toe? Here is the place you can find something new. The goal of this project is to bring people a visually appealing, easy to use and gamer freindly environment of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe. We wanted to not just make a fun game, but also make the experience easier for our users. By providing this virtual version of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, our goal was to minimize time wasted drawing the boards and amount of resources needed to make games. We also realized that people may not always have access to a another person to play against. Our goal was then to find a way to allow for a user to play by themselves. The solution was to develop an AI that would be a fun and challenging opponent to play agianst.

## How to Play

### Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is like regular Tic Tac Toe, except Ultimate!

##### The rules are as follows:

* First player selects what large section they want to start in, then selects a section on the smaller board to place the first mark.

* The second player then has to play on the regular Tic Tac Toe board, that lies in the section corresponding with the spot the first player placed their mark in.

* The players then keep alternating back and forth, playing on the board that corresponds with the other players move.
* You win a board like a regular Tic Tac Toe game, with three marks that lie in a row, column or diagonal.

* If the previous players mark corresponds to a board that is completely full, or has been won by a player, then the current player can play any board they want.

* If no one can win three boards that lie in a row, column or diagonal, then the Ultimate Tic Tac Toe game results in a draw.
