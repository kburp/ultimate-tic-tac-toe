Want to try a new game? Tired of boring Tic Tac Toe? Here is the place you can find something new. The goal of this project is to bring people a visually appealing, easy to use and gamer freindly environment of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe. We wanted to not just make a fun game, but also make the experience easier for our users. By providing this virtual version of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, our goal was to minimize time wasted drawing the boards and amount of resources needed to make games. We also realized that people may not always have access to a another person to play against. Our goal was then to find a way to allow for a user to play by themselves. The solution was to develop an AI that would be a fun and challenging opponent to play agianst.

We used pygame for our project. If you don't have pygame, follow directions below to install.
* go to command line
* run following command: pip install pygame

How to Access the Game
* First download the game by either cloning the ultimate-tic-tac-toe repository, or just downloading the files.
* With your terminal of choice, navigate into the ultimate-tic-tac-toe directory (use cd if on windows).
* There are two versions of ultimate tic-tac-toe you can play: text or graphical.
